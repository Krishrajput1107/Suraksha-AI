## Project Title

SuRक्षा - AI Powered Home Security and Surveillance System

## User Interface Design [prototype].

The goal of the user-centric SuRक्षा project is to improve user security and safety by utilizing their current security camera equipment. The project's design is founded on the concepts of User-Centered Design (UCD), which give the end-user's wants, preferences, and behaviors first priority throughout the development process. The following key factors demonstrate how SuRक्षा satisfies UCD requirements:

1. **User study and Understanding**: A great deal of study has been done to learn about the security apprehensions, problems, and expectations of the target users regarding such a system. This data is essential for determining SuRक्षा's features, operations, and user interface.

2. **Iterative Design method**: A constant method of gathering user feedback and integrating it into the design is used in the development of SuRक्षा. This methodology guarantees that the system develops according to real user requirements and preferences, as opposed to conjecture.

3. **Usability Testing**: To detect any usability problems, assess how intuitive the user interface is, and obtain input for enhancements, regular usability testing sessions are carried out with representative users. This guarantees a seamless user experience and makes SuRक्षा easy to use.

4. **Multi-platform Accessibility**: SuRक्षा accommodates customers' varied needs and preferences by providing a smartphone app for real-time updates and a web app for operating the cameras and a dashboard. This ensures accessibility across several platforms.

5. **Personalization and Customization**: Users can configure detection preferences, create custom alarms, and edit the user interface to suit their tastes by customizing and personalizing SuRक्षा to meet their unique needs.

6. **Easy and Seamless Integration**: SuRक्षा is made to work with consumers' current security camera configurations in an intuitive and seamless manner, reducing the need for complicated installs or extra hardware. This user-centric strategy improves the entire user experience and lowers adoption obstacles.

7. **Continual Improvement**: In order to make sure that SuRक्षा stays applicable, efficient, and user-friendly over time, it was designed with the idea of continual improvement. User feedback and developing technologies are incorporated into the system.

8. **Design Consistency**: To provide a seamless experience across different components, a unified design system is followed with consistent patterns for visuals, interactions and terminology.

9. **Accessibility and Inclusivity**: The design process actively considers accessibility needs for users with disabilities or impairments. This includes ensuring the user interfaces are compatible with assistive technologies and following web accessibility guidelines.

## Design Documents

- **Use Case Diagram**
  The primary features of the SuRक्षा system and user interactions are depicted in the use case diagram. The main player is the user, who has the ability to log in, set up CCTV cameras, access the admin dashboard, and use the mobile app.

  Use cases illustrate the main features of the system, such as object, anomaly, and fire detection; they also show how to receive real-time updates; interact with the chatbot; and visualize data.

  Associations and relationships are used to illustrate the relationships between the actors and use cases. The use cases for object detection, anomaly detection, fire detection, receiving real-time updates, interacting with a chatbot, and visualizing data, for instance, are included in the "View Admin Dashboard" and "View Mobile App" use cases.

  The "Receive Real-Time Updates" and "Respond to Incidents" use cases are linked to Security Personnel, another player in the diagram. The "Respond to Incidents" use case expands on the "Receive Real-Time Updates" use case by stating that reacting to events is an extension of getting real-time information.

![Use Case Diagram](./use-case-diagram.png)

- **Activity Diagram**
  The overall flow and exchanges between the user, the SuRक्षा system, and security staff are depicted in the activity diagram. Initially, the user needs to log in with their existing account or create a new one in order to use the system.

  The user chooses and configures the camera settings if they choose to configure CCTV cameras. At that point, the system simultaneously detects flames, anomalies, and objects. In addition, it provides updates, processes data in real time, and updates the admin dashboard and mobile app.

  In addition to performing administrative duties, the user can browse the admin dashboard to see data and communicate with the chatbot to question and control functionalities.

  Concurrently, security staff gets real-time updates in the event that an incident is discovered. After that, they can handle the situation by sending out teams, getting in touch with emergency services, or putting safety procedures in place.

  Using the fork notation, the diagram shows the parallel execution of individual tasks. It also includes supplementary annotations that explain particular actions or functionalities involved in particular steps.

![Activity Diagram](./activity-diagram.png)

- **Class Diagram**
  Users, cameras, and incidents are managed by the central `SuRक्षाSystem` class.

  Individual CCTV cameras are represented by the `Camera` class, which stores data about them such as location, settings, and camera ID. Its techniques for identifying items, irregularities, and fires allow the system to perform its essential surveillance functions.

  Users, including administrators and security staff, are represented by the `User` class, which has attributes defined by the `UserType` enumeration, such as credentials.

  The detected events, including the incident type ({IncidentType} enum), location, timestamp, and status ({IncidentStatus} enum), are encapsulated in the `Incident` class.

  The `SecurityPersonnel` class is used to represent employees who are in charge of reacting to situations in a specific way.

  The types ({ObjectType{ and {AnomalyType} enums), locations, and timestamps of detected entities are stored in supporting classes like {Object{, {Anomaly{, and `Fire}.

  Camera locations and setup settings are managed using classes such as `Location` and `CameraSettings`.

  The connections between classes show how different parts work together and rely on one another. For example, the composition connection between {SuRक्षाSystem} and {Camera} indicates that the system has more than one camera.

## Patent Research

Given that our SuRक्षा research seems to incorporate unique and non-obvious technical breakthroughs, it can definitely qualify for a patent. We might be able to patent the combination of AI-powered object detection, anomaly detection, fire detection, real-time updates, and a chatbot interface for engaging with CCTV camera data.

We should perform a comprehensive prior art search before filing for a patent to make sure that our idea is actually original and has not been anticipated by already developed technology. To help our team navigate the patent application process, which usually entails producing a comprehensive specification, claims, and supporting documentation, we need to speak with a patent attorney or agent.

But it's important to remember that because software is abstract and AI technology is always changing, patenting software and AI-related ideas might be difficult. Our claims might be examined by the patent office to make sure they are not just abstract concepts or algorithms and that they fit the requirements for patentable subject matter.

We believe that our patent application could be strengthened if our invention includes particular technical advancements such new machine learning algorithms, data processing methods, or hardware integrations.

We may still take into account alternative types of intellectual property protection, such as copyrights for the software code or trade secrets for proprietary algorithms or data, even if our innovation is not patentable.
